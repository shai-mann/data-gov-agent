"You are a data.gov assistant whose job is to help users find and evaluate datasets from the U.S. government's open data portal.

The user wants datasets that can answer their question: "Find datasets about climate change".

Your task is to provide a list of the **most relevant datasets** using only the tools provided. You have access to:

- packageNameSearch: Find datasets by name or similar keywords (metadata may be limited). Use very few keywords here, and skip obvious terms like "U.S."
- packageSearch: Search for datasets by keywords (includes metadata). Use more targeted keywords here, focusing on the user’s query and any promising dataset names you found in the previous step.
- selectDataset: Select a dataset by providing its ID, title, and a short reason why it may help answer the user’s question.

Follow this workflow carefully:

1. **Start with packageNameSearch** to identify promising dataset names or related keywords. Repeat this step until you have a solid list of keywords.
2. **Use packageSearch** with refined keywords to retrieve datasets.
3. **As soon as you find a dataset that looks promising**, immediately call **selectDataset** with its ID, title, and your reason for selecting it. Do this each time you encounter a good candidate, not just at the end.
4. **Verify format compatibility**: only select datasets that clearly provide CSV resources. Do NOT select datasets in unsupported formats.
5. **Iterate** as needed: adjust keywords, limits, or offsets, and continue searching until you have selected about 10 strong candidates.

Guidelines:

- Prioritize datasets that are directly relevant to the user’s query.
- Use precise keywords; avoid vague or overly broad terms.
- Ensure every dataset you select could realistically be used to answer the user’s question.

Important:
- Always use selectDataset at the moment you identify a strong candidate.
- Do not wait until the end to select; your goal is to build up the list incrementally as you search.
- Output only the selected datasets; do not include explanations or commentary outside of selectDataset calls.
- You do NOT need to select all datasets from a single search result. You should expect to make multiple iterations through the workflow.

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

The earliest data dates vary considerably by state and region: Maine, Pennsylvania, and Texas have data since 1900. The western Pacific region that includes Guam, American Samoa, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau have data since 1978. Other states and regions have earliest dates between those extremes. The latest data in all states and regions is from the present day. The major parameter in DSI-3240 is precipitation amounts, which are measurements of hourly or daily precipitation accumulation. Accumulation was for longer periods of time if for any reason the rain gauge was out of service or no observer was present. DSI 3240_01 contains data grouped by state; DSI 3240_02 contains data grouped by year.",

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

The primary source of data for this file is approximately 5,500 US National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and cooperative observer stations in the United States of America, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and various Pacific Islands. The earliest data dates vary considerably by state and region: Maine, Pennsylvania, and Texas have data since 1900. The western Pacific region that includes Guam, American Samoa, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau have data since 1978. Other states and regions have earliest dates between those extremes. The latest data in all states and regions is from the present day. The major parameter in DSI-3240 is precipitation amounts, which are measurements of hourly or daily precipitation accumulation. Accumulation was for longer periods of time if for any reason the rain gauge was out of service or no observer was present. DSI 3240_01 contains data grouped by state; DSI 3240_02 contains data grouped by year.",

      "notes": "The datasets comprise greenhouse gas (GHG) emission factors (Factors) for 1,016 U.S. commodities as defined by the 2017 version of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

      "notes": "The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.For the most accurate, up to date statistics on traffic fatalities, please refer to the <a href=\\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/traffic-data/traffic-data-collision.page\\" style=\\"color:#187bcd;\\">NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page</a> (updated weekly) or <a href=\\"http://www.nycvzv.info/\\" style=\\"color:#187bcd;\\">Vision Zero View</a> (updated monthly).\\r\\n\\r\\n</p>\\r\\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

      "notes": "The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.For the most accurate, up to date statistics on traffic fatalities, please refer to the <a href=\\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/traffic-data/traffic-data-collision.page\\" style=\\"color:#187bcd;\\">NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page</a> (updated weekly) or <a href=\\"http://www.nycvzv.info/\\" style=\\"color:#187bcd;\\">Vision Zero View</a> (updated monthly).\\r\\n\\r\\n</p>\\r\\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

In cases of legal proceedings, Federal regulations generally prohibit NWS employees from appearing as witnesses in litigation not involving the United States.\\"]"

The primary source of data for this file is approximately 5,500 US National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and cooperative observer stations in the United States of America, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and various Pacific Islands. The earliest data dates vary considerably by state and region: Maine, Pennsylvania, and Texas have data since 1900. The western Pacific region that includes Guam, American Samoa, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau have data since 1978. Other states and regions have earliest dates between those extremes. The latest data in all states and regions is from the present day. The major parameter in DSI-3240 is precipitation amounts, which are measurements of hourly or daily precipitation accumulation. Accumulation was for longer periods of time if for any reason the rain gauge was out of service or no observer was present. DSI 3240_01 contains data grouped by state; DSI 3240_02 contains data grouped by year.",

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

The primary source of data for this file is approximately 5,500 US National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and cooperative observer stations in the United States of America, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and various Pacific Islands. The earliest data dates vary considerably by state and region: Maine, Pennsylvania, and Texas have data since 1900. The western Pacific region that includes Guam, American Samoa, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau have data since 1978. Other states and regions have earliest dates between those extremes. The latest data in all states and regions is from the present day. The major parameter in DSI-3240 is precipitation amounts, which are measurements of hourly or daily precipitation accumulation. Accumulation was for longer periods of time if for any reason the rain gauge was out of service or no observer was present. DSI 3240_01 contains data grouped by state; DSI 3240_02 contains data grouped by year.",

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

The earliest data dates vary considerably by state and region: Maine, Pennsylvania, and Texas have data since 1900. The western Pacific region that includes Guam, American Samoa, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau have data since 1978. Other states and regions have earliest dates between those extremes. The latest data in all states and regions is from the present day. The major parameter in DSI-3240 is precipitation amounts, which are measurements of hourly or daily precipitation accumulation. Accumulation was for longer periods of time if for any reason the rain gauge was out of service or no observer was present. DSI 3240_01 contains data grouped by state; DSI 3240_02 contains data grouped by year.",

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

The earliest data dates vary considerably by state and region: Maine, Pennsylvania, and Texas have data since 1900. The western Pacific region that includes Guam, American Samoa, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau have data since 1978. Other states and regions have earliest dates between those extremes. The latest data in all states and regions is from the present day. The major parameter in DSI-3240 is precipitation amounts, which are measurements of hourly or daily precipitation accumulation. Accumulation was for longer periods of time if for any reason the rain gauge was out of service or no observer was present. DSI 3240_01 contains data grouped by state; DSI 3240_02 contains data grouped by year.",

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

The earliest data dates vary considerably by state and region: Maine, Pennsylvania, and Texas have data since 1900. The western Pacific region that includes Guam, American Samoa, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau have data since 1978. Other states and regions have earliest dates between those extremes. The latest data in all states and regions is from the present day. The major parameter in DSI-3240 is precipitation amounts, which are measurements of hourly or daily precipitation accumulation. Accumulation was for longer periods of time if for any reason the rain gauge was out of service or no observer was present. DSI 3240_01 contains data grouped by state; DSI 3240_02 contains data grouped by year.",

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

The earliest data dates vary considerably by state and region: Maine, Pennsylvania, and Texas have data since 1900. The western Pacific region that includes Guam, American Samoa, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau have data since 1978. Other states and regions have earliest dates between those extremes. The latest data in all states and regions is from the present day. The major parameter in DSI-3240 is precipitation amounts, which are measurements of hourly or daily precipitation accumulation. Accumulation was for longer periods of time if for any reason the rain gauge was out of service or no observer was present. DSI 3240_01 contains data grouped by state; DSI 3240_02 contains data grouped by year.",

"You are a data.gov assistant whose job is to help users find and evaluate datasets from the U.S. government's open data portal.

The user wants datasets that can answer their question: "I need economic indicators data".

Your task is to provide a list of the **most relevant datasets** using only the tools provided. You have access to:

- packageNameSearch: Find datasets by name or similar keywords (metadata may be limited). Use very few keywords here, and skip obvious terms like "U.S."
- packageSearch: Search for datasets by keywords (includes metadata). Use more targeted keywords here, focusing on the user’s query and any promising dataset names you found in the previous step.
- selectDataset: Select a dataset by providing its ID, title, and a short reason why it may help answer the user’s question.

Follow this workflow carefully:

1. **Start with packageNameSearch** to identify promising dataset names or related keywords. Repeat this step until you have a solid list of keywords.
2. **Use packageSearch** with refined keywords to retrieve datasets.
3. **As soon as you find a dataset that looks promising**, immediately call **selectDataset** with its ID, title, and your reason for selecting it. Do this each time you encounter a good candidate, not just at the end.
4. **Verify format compatibility**: only select datasets that clearly provide CSV resources. Do NOT select datasets in unsupported formats.
5. **Iterate** as needed: adjust keywords, limits, or offsets, and continue searching until you have selected about 10 strong candidates.

Guidelines:

- Prioritize datasets that are directly relevant to the user’s query.
- Use precise keywords; avoid vague or overly broad terms.
- Ensure every dataset you select could realistically be used to answer the user’s question.

Important:
- Always use selectDataset at the moment you identify a strong candidate.
- Do not wait until the end to select; your goal is to build up the list incrementally as you search.
- Output only the selected datasets; do not include explanations or commentary outside of selectDataset calls.
- You do NOT need to select all datasets from a single search result. You should expect to make multiple iterations through the workflow.

"You are a data.gov assistant whose job is to help users find and evaluate datasets from the U.S. government's open data portal.

The user wants datasets that can answer their question: "I need economic indicators data".

Your task is to provide a list of the **most relevant datasets** using only the tools provided. You have access to:

- packageNameSearch: Find datasets by name or similar keywords (metadata may be limited). Use very few keywords here, and skip obvious terms like "U.S."
- packageSearch: Search for datasets by keywords (includes metadata). Use more targeted keywords here, focusing on the user’s query and any promising dataset names you found in the previous step.
- selectDataset: Select a dataset by providing its ID, title, and a short reason why it may help answer the user’s question.

Follow this workflow carefully:

1. **Start with packageNameSearch** to identify promising dataset names or related keywords. Repeat this step until you have a solid list of keywords.
2. **Use packageSearch** with refined keywords to retrieve datasets.
3. **As soon as you find a dataset that looks promising**, immediately call **selectDataset** with its ID, title, and your reason for selecting it. Do this each time you encounter a good candidate, not just at the end.
4. **Verify format compatibility**: only select datasets that clearly provide CSV resources. Do NOT select datasets in unsupported formats.

      "notes": "This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.",

The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\\n\\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions,",

      "notes": "This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.",

      "notes": "This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.",

      "notes": "This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.",

      "notes": "This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.",

Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself.

      "notes": "This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.",

The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\\n\\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions,",

      "notes": "This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.",

Version 3 was released in September 2012 with the addition of data from two additional station networks. Changes to the processing system associated with the version 3 release also allowed for updates to occur 7 days a week rather than only on most weekdays. Version 3 contains station-based measurements from well over 90,000 land-based stations worldwide, about two thirds of which are for precipitation measurement only. Other meteorological elements include, but are not limited to, daily maximum and minimum temperature, temperature at the time of observation, snowfall and snow depth. Over 25,000 stations are regularly updated with observations from within roughly the last month. The dataset is also routinely reconstructed (usually every week) from its roughly 30 data sources to ensure that GHCNd is generally in sync with its growing list of constituent sources. During this process, quality assurance checks are applied to the full dataset. Where possible, GHCNd station data are also updated daily from a variety of data streams. Station values for each daily update also undergo a suite of quality checks.",

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",

Computation of the NOAA Climate Normals is in accordance with the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), of which the United States is a member. While the WMO mandates each member nation to compute 30-year averages of meteorological quantities at least every 30 years (1931 - 1960, 1961 - 1990, 1991 - 2020, etc.), the WMO recommends a decadal update, in part to incorporate newer weather stations. Further, the NOAA NCDC has a responsibility to fulfill the mandate of Congress \\"... to establish and record the climatic conditions of the United States.\\" This responsibility stems from a provision of the Organic Act of October 1, 1890, which established the Weather Bureau as a civilian agency (15 U.S.C. 311)."

      "notes": "This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.",

Version 3 was released in September 2012 with the addition of data from two additional station networks. Changes to the processing system associated with the version 3 release also allowed for updates to occur 7 days a week rather than only on most weekdays. Version 3 contains station-based measurements from well over 90,000 land-based stations worldwide, about two thirds of which are for precipitation measurement only. Other meteorological elements include, but are not limited to, daily maximum and minimum temperature, temperature at the time of observation, snowfall and snow depth. Over 25,000 stations are regularly updated with observations from within roughly the last month. The dataset is also routinely reconstructed (usually every week) from its roughly 30 data sources to ensure that GHCNd is generally in sync with its growing list of constituent sources. During this process, quality assurance checks are applied to the full dataset. Where possible, GHCNd station data are also updated daily from a variety of data streams. Station values for each daily update also undergo a suite of quality checks.",

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",
