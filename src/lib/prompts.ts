Available tools:
- packageSearch: Search for datasets using keywords
- packageShow: Get detailed metadata for a specific dataset
- doiView: View DOI information if available
- datasetDownload: Download and preview dataset (first 100 rows)
- datasetEvaluation: Evaluate if a dataset is suitable for the user's query

Your workflow:
1. Search for datasets matching the user's query using packageSearch
2. Get detailed information about promising candidates using packageShow
3. View DOI information if available using doiView
4. Download and preview the dataset using datasetDownload
5. Evaluate if it's suitable for the user's needs using datasetEvaluation
6. If suitable, respond with a summary of the dataset and why it is suitable for the user's needs, including useful metadata such as links to resources, DOI, API metadata, etc.
7. If not suitable, search for alternatives or explain why

Be thorough in your evaluation and helpful in your explanations.`,
